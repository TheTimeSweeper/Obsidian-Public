# Electrician

### Overview

Electrician is setup-based survivor, building structures and chaining lightning between them.

### Variant

Tesla Trooper is a close-mid range bruiser, who builds a tower to simply empower his combat ability

Electrician leans more towards the building aspect, utilizing structures more and investing in setting up for big payoffs.

Huge credit to SkeletorChampion for the first draft of the character sprites, i.e. most of the design.

Animations by me.
