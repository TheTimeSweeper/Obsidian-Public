# Tesla Trooper
### Main Kit
Nice
### Rorr
overall same
- M1 Like melee+ range. Chains to 3 targets
- M2 area blast in front of you
- M3 totally not loader scrap barrier
- M4 build tower
    - M2 now blasts from the tower
### Rorr Starstorm-style variant: Electrician
- M1 same, prioritizes conductors
- M2 throw a ~~pylon~~ conductor forward. When this conductor is hit by any electricity, it spreads this electricity to all nearby enemies and conductors. 2 charges.
- M3 zap to any of your structures, damaging those that you cross. Stays in the structure for a sec and can be repeated. Has x charges that all replenish at once
- M4 tower. Periodically zaps all pylons in a large radius X times then goes away.
### Variant: Nemesis
- What to keep: lightning, close-mid range bruiser
- ~~What to twist: Tower -> Energy Meter~~
    - ~~Dead tesla trooper brought back using tower parts~~
    - ~~Instead of occasionally being empowered by the tower, you have an energy meter you can occasionally consume segments of to empower your skills~~
- What to twist: Tower -> Heat Meter (SkeletorChampion)
	- Overuses the lightning, at which point he overheats
	- Overheat is weaponized, switching skills to heated versions that "spend" heat to vent it out
#### Passive:
- [Stress] abilites build up heat. Building up too much heat causes you to Overheat, changing your abilities to [Vent] versions that expend the heat
- *heat does not dissipate once you're overheated, you have to use moves*
- *in general, primary builds/vents heat slowly but surely*
- *secondary vents/builds heat opposite in a decent chunk so you can stay in either form*
- *utility is utility lol*
- *special is a flanderized version of the form, building/venting a TON of heat to get you to the other form quick if you want*

#### Default set:
- Generally single-target damage
- M1: [Stress 10/s] Channel lightning
	- continuously build heat and shoot lightning forward
		- the longer it's held, the further it goes
	- let go to build a chunk of heat and shoot a lightning bolt at the tip
	- *generally higher DPS when spammed more often, building more heat.* 
	- *better at longer range when charged, but builds heat while charging, so you get less damage out of the heat built, and builds heat slower* 
- M2: [Vent 30] Hammer slam
	- expend some heat and slam hammer down, leaving fire zones (or pillars of fire) on the ground in a line in front of you
	- underflows, if not enough heat, the distance or damage (probably damage) is lowered
		- that or just have a heat requirement, yeah that's probably simpler
	- *a good, more single-targed version of a heated move*
	- *I like the flipped one being on secondary, you can really balance primary and secondary if you want to stay in either form, nicely done*
- M3: [Stress 10, 10/hit] Tesla util
	- shield yourself in a layer of electricity. hits are absorbed and generate heat
	- *Unsure about this one because shielding damage is better for short-range design. will still give it a try first to see. Maybe it'll see use by letting you go into crowds, generate heat, overheat then use aoe moves on them*
	- *should it last after you're already overheated?*
- M4: [Stress 50] Big Shock
	- generate a large amount of heat one heavy overcharged bolt on a single target
	- *basically the whole-ass tower move*

#### Overheated set:
- more AoE, overall higher damage
- M1: [Vent 10/s] Hot air
	- continuously vent superheated air at targets in front of you, adding stacks of overheat
	- with enough overheat stacks, the air around them is superheated into plasma, causing an explosion that applies overheat as well
- M2: [Stress 10, 10/bounce] Hammer Slam
	- Generate a chunk of heat to charge the hammer and slam it down, bouncing lightning on nearby enemies
	- lightning can bounce back to you generating more heat for each bounce received
	- *basically unchanged from your idea. both your hammer moves were*
		- *a hit*
- M3: [Vent 15] Short Dash
	- Vent a small amount of heat to quickly reposition, 3 charges
	- *spends a small, controlled amount of heat when used once to reposition your AoEs, but if you need to use it all 3 times in a sticky situation, you're missing out on damage that heat could have been used for*
- M4: [Vent, 20/s] Oven (toggled)
	- spend heat at a high rate to vent superheated air all around you, creating a large overheating zone
	- *primary triggers overheated stacks, so can be used alongisde primary to spend heat fast and deal a lot of chain aoe*
# Desolator
## Main Kit
Nice
### Alts
- - Alt m1: continuous beam
    - Alt m2: continuous puke of projectiles that leave pools on the ground
    - Alt X: something more interesting
## Nemesis
- What to keep: AOE monster
- What to twist: Continuous dot -> buildup one big payoff
# Chrono Legionnaire
## Main Kit
Almost nice
#### Current Beta Kit
- Passive
    - Instead of sprinting, You time-skip from place to place, after which, you are Disabled for a short time based on distance.
- M1: Neutron Rifle
    - Fire a time-stopping rifle for % damage. Enemies hit are applied [Chrono Sickness] for x% of their health
- M2: Chrono I.V.A.N.
    - Attach a pulse bomb to an enemy. After a delay, the bomb explodes for x% damage
    - Hidden: can be applied to allies
- M3: Chronosphere
    - Highlight an area, then highlight a second area. Enemies and Allies in the first area are teleported to the second area. ~~Enemies affected are applied [Chrono Sickness] for x% of their health.~~
- M4 Deconstructing
    - Shortly focus your rifle on an enemy. Dealing up to x% damage and continuously applying [Chrono Sickness] for up to x% their health. If an enemy’s health is below the [Chrono Sickness] threshold, they vanish from existence.
        - Keyword: when used on an ally, they are temporarily pulled out of existence. Unable to attack, but immune to damage from all sources.
    - ~~Hidden: skips matrix phase 4 if he is vanished in phase 3~~

Thoughts

- M4 is just m1 plus. Should add the whole time-stopping from the game
- M4 overall has a lot to be desired
    - Vanishing doesn’t see much use on most enemies
        - This is because of its %health. When it did more, bosses were destroyed way way too easily
    - Using it wastes its whole cooldown. Should split it up into multiple charges
- Absolutely proud of sprint passive, but right now the crazy mobility and drawback sees little actual use in the kit’s overall design. It’s just cool

#### Dee’s proposed kit

- primary hits a single target and scales up the execution debuff. can carry the same theming and animation as his current special where its the little siphon. Doesnt do a ton of dmg on its own; its a _bit_ weak but not so much to be unusable, but its main atraction is the debuff
- seccondary spreads a timebomb. relatively low cooldown time, might have multiple charges to work with. The timebomb does not stack so youre encouraged to spread it across multiple enemies.
- utility's the same. maybe smaller radius but otherwise this is fine as-is. maybe smaller radius and range but lower cooldown as to encourage more active use? idk i really like this one its really fun.
- special is replaced to an ability that stops enemies within a small radius, like a little blast. after a while the enemies start moving by themselves but the debuffs stay "paused". timebomb while paused stays there, and execution debuff doesnt decay, but it also doesnt execute enemies.
    - _holding_ the special charges up a _bigger_ blast radius that un-pauses the enemies, and "triggers" the debuffs (timebomb forcefully explodes when un-paused, and the execution tresshold becomes active again alowing enemies to be executed)

I’m not 100% sold on everything but the general idea of being a setup and payoff character by building up the debuffs and bombs then setting them off is really really cool

- Bit iffy on the special having two different functions. I feel like that could be pulled off in other parts of the kit

### Alts:
help
## Variant: Time-lost
Spent too much time in the in-between, too much fucking with time and positions and reality, now trapped in purgatory
### Concepts
"Clones" of you from different points of time
- passively every move you do is repeated like second later by another spectre of you
- different moves have different durations that the clone stays around, so you can combo them in different ways

"Shades" of you from different points in time appear around you doing different actions. 
- Choose a shade and you take over that timeline, performing the action it was doing
# **GI**
- M1 shoot gun
- M2 caltrops that slow
- M3 slide
- M4 barricade. Can’t move but abilities are empowered
	- M1 shoot gun big
	- M2 mine that stuns
	- M3 no change that’s it no more complication

Since I just wrote the code for it
- Alt m1 rocket (well I didn’t write the code for this one :P)
- Alt m1 barricade big guardian gi rocket

# Conscript
### Initial Prototype
- M1: shoot gun
	- real beefy and strong but has to reload
- M2: molotov
	- prototyped just throwing the in-game molotov, all we need to do is clone that projectile and edit it's speed so it throws further, and increase its fire pool radius real big
- M3: armor and move speed buff
	- prototyped just applying a buff, _maybe_ should rally in an area
- M4: garrison providing a buff in a small area
	- lowers/removes reload time on m1, sets m2 stocks to max on first gaining buff
### Current Beta
- M1: shoot gun
	- real beefy and strong but has to reload
- M2: molotov
	- can be shot midair to explode
- M3: charge
	- repositions garrisons
- M4: garrison/bunker providing a buff in a small area
	- lowers/removes reload time on m1, sets m2 stocks to max on first gaining buff

- Alt M1 flak trooper
	- Hitscan poof in an area (should be able to use chrono m1 code)
- Alt M2 terror drone
	- Engi spider mine but latches on becomes a weakpoint that you shoot to explode

He's meant to mirror GI like in the original games, them being the basic units of both factions  
So they both do
- m1 basic gun
- m2 basic projectile
- m3 movement
- m4 empower m1 and m2
# Prisma trooper inspired by tesla

- M1 head beam in a flat cone
    - hold to charge, increasing damage and width of cone
        - Quick charges will have overall more dps on single targets. Charging up will be better for crowds but slower
    - fires automatically at full charge
    - Piercing so you can reach pylons, speaking of which
- M2 2-3 charges of prism pylons.
    - Any beams that hit these pylons are split to nearby enemies (or other pylons, continuing the chain)
- M3 either beam through your network of things, or skeletor’s defensive one
- M4 prism tower(s), boosts m1
    - Tower hits you and you diffract big fuckin beam
    - Damage increases to a cap, Range increases uncapped
    - 2 stocks of tower, and prisma is more setup reliant.
        - Instead of being powered up on spread occasions, she plays with her setup more consistently active.
            - You generally always want pylons to do aoe, you generally always want a tower to be boosting your damage.
            - You can use both your towers at once, but that’s putting them both on cooldown where you won’t be as strong
            - So she’s more about managing your resources.
- M4 alt prism tank turrets that shoot alongside you
    - Instead of slower big damage, multiple instances of faster damage, better procs, etc

# Yuri
- M4 control multiple enemies.
	- Can do at full health, limited time
	- Chirr but epic
- M2 psi blast at self and all enemies,
	- hurts enemies and controlled allies. This is how you fight enemies. You damage them while they’re under your control before you lose them
- M3 swap places with a controlled enemy
- No m1? M1 is mind control?
- M1 or M4 is some kind of knockback, so you can control the positioning of enemies and controlled allies
- Maybe psychokinesis

Yuri + brute combo to fill out skill slots
- M1 brute slam
- M2 yuri psi blast self and all controlled enemies
- M3 brute leap slam
- M4 yuri mind control

# Cryo Legionnaire
Not ra2. Ra3 sneaking in
- M1 - Freeze: cryo spray, assisted by two drones accompanying you (not autonomous)
	- mei freeze after a bit
- M2 - Focus a beam and drones on a single target. If they are frozen, explode, chain reaction
- M3 - rocket up in the sky, recast to crash, starts floating down after a couple seconds if not recast, then loses altitude faster than Arti's hover
- M4 - Cryo Bombardment from drones in a line, can be cast during util
# Rocketeer
Challenge to design a full flight character, adding tradeoffs to the freedom of flying (which usually makes things boring) by making you need to get close
- Passive - No jump. Just free flight
	- No fuel limit or nothing
	- Feathers and quails? uhhhhhhh
- M1 - dual pistols, falloff
- M2 - explosion around you/dive bomb
- M3 - uh pharah boost? Probably omnidirectional
	- boost on a fuel limit, recharges faster on ground
	- doesn't limit free flight, but rather expands on the free flight
- M4 - ??
- possibly something that is horizontal and has to be channeled, making you stay in danger range
- ~~could be primary knocks you back, so naturally doing it downwards propels you upwards, making the falloff worse, so you want to stay level or even on the ground~~
	- neh the whole fuckin point of being a rocketeer is raining fire below

# MCV, yes really
Prototype:
- ideally proper top down camera and mouse cursor but for prototype just pull up the camera real high and aim
- Huntresstracker component to seek all characters
- M1 selects allies
- M2 selects their target
- M3 structure menu?
	- Prototype: nothing
- M4 unit menu
	- Prototype: summon random survivor
- Target chests to make them open them
- Inventory is shared between all units

Potential is truly infinite here. Could add an actual resource system for buying units, repairing self, buying structures and selling them to reposition. All ears for any ideas
# Steel Ronin
Or any of the other weeb units
- Maybe as bosses/golem-tier big enemies
# Other Content
- Purchasable terror drone
    - Maybe enemy
- Kirov equipment
- IFV interactable
    - Purchase, enter vehicle, you drive it around and your skills are boosted somehow
