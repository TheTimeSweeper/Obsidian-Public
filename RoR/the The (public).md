## The

These are concepts for ror2 characters that I’ve wanted to make, but don’t have time or the opportunity to prioritize them over the other things I work on.

- If you’d like to make them real, you can basically commission me to do them so I can justify working on them.
- Alternatively, you can contribute by donating less then the listed amount to my ko-fi. If multiple people contribute and the amount reaches enough for a character I can get to work.
    - List the entry you want to help fund, or “Any” and the fund will go to whichever is highest.
- Alternatively, you can support some projects by commissioning other artists to make missing Models and Animations that I can’t do myself.

Any contribution is a million percent appreciated.

## Not Existing

Things I’ve messed around with, concepted, and prototyped, but just don’t have the time/priority to really dive in and finish

### Cyberninja (Genji Overwatch) [$**500**]### 
![](<Public/img/Attachment 21.png>)

I've commissioned some aweosme ror2-fitting concept art and made a prototype. I'm a big overwatch weeb player and would love to make him real, but I haven't had the time

### Plague Knight [$**500**]

![](<Attachment 2.gif>)

One of my original fantasies. I maintain that he will happen some day but he's been on the back burner out of the amount of work it'd take.

I've made somewhat a prototype of bomb selecting and that's about it

### Katamari [$**300**]

![](<Attachment 3.gif>)

Yes really. The wife keeps telling me to do it.

## Existing

My existing guys always have more to be done that I don’t have enough time to put on the priority list.

### The Alien Hominid [**$100**]

- More weapons
    - BBGun, Lightning gun, Anything else
- More Mutations
    - Something he’s really missing to make his gameplay fully realized
    - Fire trail, Jetpack, The others from AHI, Castle Crashers sandwich
- More RoR2-ifying [**+$100**]
    - Putting in the work to make sounds and visuals not so cartoony

### The MatchMaker [**$100**]

- More alt skills
    - M1 battleaxe (spends 2 matches, big combo finisher)
    - M2 magic missiles/laser of the father (shoot many missles for each match)
    - M3 blink dust (matches passively give in-combat move speed instead of armor)
- Whole dang visual revamp [**+$100**]
    - An awesome ror2-ified greek letter construct-inspired concept that’ll take whole remodeling and Icon redo. Current version in classic config of course.

### The Not On This List [**n/a**]

These characters I would prefer to keep money out of

- EnforcerGang, Paladin
- Tesla Trooper, Desolator, Chrono Legionnaire

## Mods with other people

Will be odd to commission just me for this. The [other creators] will have to be on board, and of course the money will be split.

### Letters from Petrichor [SkeletorChampion] [**$400**]

A big really Vanilla-adjacent original mod. Survivors and enemies and stuff based on in-game lore and concepts

### Cloudburst Enemies [CloudBurstTeam(CBT)] [**$200**]

the game needs more enemies and cloudburst has concepts

### Helldiver [tsuyoikenko and EarthZebra] [**$600**]

will take a ton of work but tsuyoikenko did a bunch, we have a model, I barely prototyped stratagems. He can be made real, we just need some time/motivation.

### Aetherium Survivor [Ragon] [**$600**]

there is a cool concept that is sitting on the sidelines right now.

### Rhythm Survivor [Nebby] [**$600**]

Nebby and I are the worst duo to have planned to make something cause of how busy we both are, but yeah we like Metal Hellsinger and a survivor that shoots to a rhythm would be cool.

### Archangel [KingEnderBrine] [**$400**]

A new character in Jame’s Extended Paladin Universe

We have a model and somewhat of a kit. He would be ecstatic

## Schizomaxxing

Like “Not Existing” but just ideas, kits of varying levels of completeness.

### The Red Alerts [**$100-$500**]

[The Cool Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WavFNvAzKfSAuyXztwtwvET97go3OOVo3DSLpLfQxIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### The WoL [**$300**]

Wizard of Legend

- Pick up and reorder spells mid run
- Choose from a set of beginning spells and the others you only get mid run
    - Fuckin just have the entire spellbook y not
- But yeah that’s a shit load of work, even if he has like 10 spells that’d be rad

### The RogueL [**$300**]

Rogue legacy is like my favorite game

- M1 sword, M2 spells, M3 dash, M4 specials
    - specials based on roguel 1 classes. Roguel 2 had much better more varied classes but that’s like making a new character for every class. I’ll keep this one simple
- Actually choose randomized child on each death (and stage?)

### The Quantum translocator [**$200**]

- An [old flash game (download ruffle)](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/548371) where you place a shadow and jump to it.
- It’s an old favorite of mine and I wanna do a concept inspired by it

### The Boy (MM Link) [**$500**]

- M1 sword
- M2 bow/bomb/whatevs
- M3 Z/shield. Space to side hop roll and backflip
- M4 fierce deity mask
    - M1 sword with beam
    - M2 spin?
    - M3 uh same?

### The Fast Boy (OOT Speedrun Link) [**$500**]

- Complete with glitches you can actually perform
- M1 sword
- M2 Shield
- M3 Z
    - Space: roll/side hop/backflip
- M4 Bomb
    - E: Pick up bomb
- This allows for
    - ISG
    - HESS
    - Mega flip
    - Fuckin bomb hovering
    - Fuckin SRM if we can gamify it somehow (and are also insane)

### The Goth GF [**$500**]

Original Plague Doctor/Corvid inspired character

- Passive: Give armoire on each hit
    - Crows flyin around with higher armer
        - Crows are the armor?
- M1 5 piercing feathers
- M2 wing cut swing
- M3 split into birds
- M4 birdemic form ancient leshen

### Mitomancer [**$500**]

- Throw images/clones/stuff somewhere and be able to swap to/control/order them
- I love the idea of first person micromanaging

## The Dota

Too many league characters. We need some dota up in here

### The Clink [**$300**]

- Just one of the guys I liked playing. Invisibling and shooting arrows and eating enemies sounds fun

### The Pugna [**$300**]

- Oblivion

### The Not Leoric [**$300**]

- You die a lot
- You come back to life a lot
- General character gameplay idea, no specific character in mind

### Meepo [**$500**]

- Alternatively, see Mitomancer above

### The Rubick [**$800**]

- Steal spells from enemies.
- Would take a shit ton of work. Skills *can* be used by anyone in this game so that’s where this idea came from, but enemy skills are just ass to use as a player so I would have to have player-oriented skills to take from all enemies

### Invoker [**$100-$600**]

- See [Letters from Petrcichor](#_92zsozl33cx2)

### The Any Other Good Ideas
