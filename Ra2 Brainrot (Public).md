### Tesla Trooper

[[The 2000 volts coming up]]

Nice

Rorr overall same

- M1 Like melee+ range. Chains to 3 targets
- M2 area blast in front of you
- M3 totally not loader scrap barrier
- M4 build tower
    - M2 now blasts from the tower

Rorr starstorm-style variant: Electrician
[[Electrician (Tesla Trooper Variant) (Public)]]

- M1 same, prioritizes conductors
- M2 throw a ~~pylon~~ conductor forward. When this conductor is hit by any electricity, it spreads this electricity to all nearby enemies and conductors. 2 charges.
- M3 zap to any of your structures, damaging those that you cross. Stays in the structure for a sec and can be repeated. Has x charges that all replenish at once
- M4 tower. Periodically zaps all pylons in a large radius X times then goes away.

Nemesis

- What to keep: lightning, close-mid range bruiser
- What to twist: Tower -> Energy Meter
    - Dead tesla trooper brought back using tower parts
    - Instead of occasionally being empowered by the tower, you have an energy meter you can occasionally consume segments of to empower your skills

### Desolator

Nice

Alts

- - Alt m1: continuous beam
    - Alt m2: continuous puke of projectiles that leave pools on the ground
    - Alt X: something more interesting

Nemesis

- What to keep: AOE monster
- What to twist: Continuous dot -> buildup one big payoff

### Chrono Legionnaire

Almost nice

Current Beta Kit

- Passive
    - Instead of sprinting, You time-skip from place to place, after which, you are Disabled for a short time based on distance.
- M1: Neutron Rifle
    - Fire a time-stopping rifle for % damage. Enemies hit are applied [Chrono Sickness] for x% of their health
- M2: Chrono I.V.A.N.
    - Attach a pulse bomb to an enemy. After a delay, the bomb explodes for x% damage
    - Hidden: can be applied to allies
- M3: Chronosphere
    - Highlight an area, then highlight a second area. Enemies and Allies in the first area are teleported to the second area. ~~Enemies affected are applied [Chrono Sickness] for x% of their health.~~
- M4 Deconstructing
    - Shortly focus your rifle on an enemy. Dealing up to x% damage and continuously applying [Chrono Sickness] for up to x% their health. If an enemy’s health is below the [Chrono Sickness] threshold, they vanish from existence.
        - Keyword: when used on an ally, they are temporarily pulled out of existence. Unable to attack, but immune to damage from all sources.
    - ~~Hidden: skips matrix phase 4 if he is vanished in phase 3~~

Thoughts

- M4 is just m1 plus. Should add the whole time-stopping from the game
- M4 overall has a lot to be desired
    - Vanishing doesn’t see much use on most enemies
        - This is because of its %health. When it did more, bosses were destroyed way way too easily
    - Using it wastes its whole cooldown. Should split it up into multiple charges
- Absolutely proud of sprint passive, but right now the crazy mobility and drawback sees little actual use in the kit’s overall design. It’s just cool

Dee’s proposed kit

- primary hits a single target and scales up the execution debuff. can carry the same theming and animation as his current special where its the little siphon. Doesnt do a ton of dmg on its own; its a _bit_ weak but not so much to be unusable, but its main atraction is the debuff
- seccondary spreads a timebomb. relatively low cooldown time, might have multiple charges to work with. The timebomb does not stack so youre encouraged to spread it across multiple enemies.
- utility's the same. maybe smaller radius but otherwise this is fine as-is. maybe smaller radius and range but lower cooldown as to encourage more active use? idk i really like this one its really fun.
- special is replaced to an ability that stops enemies within a small radius, like a little blast. after a while the enemies start moving by themselves but the debuffs stay "paused". timebomb while paused stays there, and execution debuff doesnt decay, but it also doesnt execute enemies.
    - _holding_ the special charges up a _bigger_ blast radius that un-pauses the enemies, and "triggers" the debuffs (timebomb forcefully explodes when un-paused, and the execution tresshold becomes active again alowing enemies to be executed)

I’m not 100% sold on everything but the general idea of being a setup and payoff character by building up the debuffs and bombs then setting them off is really really cool

- Bit iffy on the special having two different functions. I feel like that could be pulled off in other parts of the kit

### **GI**

M1 shoot gun

M2 caltrops that slow

M3 slide

M4 barricade. Can’t move but abilities are empowered

- M1 shoot gun big
- M2 mine that stuns
- M3 no change that’s it no more complication

Since I just wrote the code for it

Alt m1 rocket (well I didn’t write the code for this one :P)

Alt m1 barricade big guardian gi rocket

### Conscript

M1: shoot gun

- real beefy and strong but has to reload

M2: molotov

- prototyped just throwing the in-game molotov, all we need to do is clone that projectile and edit it's speed so it throws further, and increase its fire pool radius real big

M3: armor and move speed buff

- prototyped just applying a buff, _maybe_ should rally in an area

M4: garrison providing a buff in a small area

- lowers/removes reload time on m1, sets m2 stocks to max on first gaining buff

He's meant to mirror GI like in the original games, them being the basic units of both factions

So they both do

m1 basic gun

m2 basic projectile

m3 movement

m4 empower m1 and m2

Alt M1 flak trooper

- Hitscan poof in an area (should be able to use chrono m1 code)

Alt M2 terror drone

- Engi spider mine but latches on becomes a weakpoint that you shoot to explode

### Prisma trooper inspired by tesla

- M1 head beam in a flat cone
    - hold to charge, increasing damage and width of cone
        - Quick charges will have overall more dps on single targets. Charging up will be better for crowds but slower
    - fires automatically at full charge
    - Piercing so you can reach pylons, speaking of which
- M2 2-3 charges of prism pylons.
    - Any beams that hit these pylons are split to nearby enemies (or other pylons, continuing the chain)
- M3 either beam through your network of things, or skeletor’s defensive one
- M4 prism tower(s), boosts m1
    - Tower hits you and you diffract big fuckin beam
    - Damage increases to a cap, Range increases uncapped
    - 2 stocks of tower, and prisma is more setup reliant.
        - Instead of being powered up on spread occasions, she plays with her setup more consistently active.
            - You generally always want pylons to do aoe, you generally always want a tower to be boosting your damage.
            - You can use both your towers at once, but that’s putting them both on cooldown where you won’t be as strong
            - So she’s more about managing your resources.
- M4 alt prism tank turrets that shoot alongside you
    - Instead of slower big damage, multiple instances of faster damage, better procs, etc

### Yuri

M4 control multiple enemies.

- Can do at full health, limited time
- Chirr but epic

M2 psi blast at self and all enemies,

- hurts enemies and controlled allies. This is how you fight enemies. You damage them while they’re under your control before you lose them

M3 swap places with a controlled enemy

No m1? M1 is mind control?

M1 or M4 is some kind of knockback, so you can control the positioning of enemies and controlled allies

Maybe psychokinesis

Yuri + brute combo to fill out skill slots

M1 brute slam

M2 yuri psi blast self and all controlled enemies

M3 brute leap slam

M4 yuri mind control

### Cryo Legionnaire

Not ra2. Ra3 sneaking in

M1 - Freeze: cryo spray, assisted by two drones accompanying you (not autonomous)

- mei freeze after a bit

M2 - Focus a beam and drones on a single target. If they are frozen, explode, chain reaction

M3 - rocket up in the sky, recast to crash, starts floating down after a couple seconds if not recast, then loses altitude faster than Arti's hover

M4 - Cryo Bombardment from drones in a line, can be cast during util

### Rocketeer

Challenge to design a full flight character, adding tradeoffs to the freedom of flying (which usually makes things boring) by making you need to get close

No jump. Just free flight

No fuel limit or nothing

- Feathers and quails? uhhhhhhh

M1 - dual pistols, falloff

M2 - explosion around you/dive bomb

M3 - uh pharah boost? Probably omnidirectional

M4 - ???

### MCV, yes really

Prototype:

ideally proper top down camera and mouse cursor but for prototype just pull up the camera real high and aim

Huntresstracker component to seek all characters

- M1 selects allies
- M2 selects their target
- M3 structure menu?
    - Prototype: nothing
- M4 unit menu
    - Prototype: summon random survivor
- Target chests to make them open them
- Inventory is shared between all units

Potential is truly infinite here. Could add an actual resource system for buying units, repairing self, buying structures and selling them to reposition. All ears for any ideas

### Steel Ronin

Or any of the other weeb units

Maybe as bosses/golem-tier big enemies
