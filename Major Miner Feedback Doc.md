### Miner thoughts

Oh by the way the color code legend is at the bottom

#### Adrenaline

- Super hard to read white text on the yellow icon
- I agree that it should fall off instead of all just disappear, as the folks have been saying. however:
    - I also like how punishing it was (maybe just not how _much_ it was punishing, but I do like the difficulty).
    - I suggest it to fall of at certain rate, but fall off faster and faster as to still encourage killing things quickly
- I’d like feedback of how long you have until your current adrenaline combo is ending
    - Perhaps some kind of UI thing that counts down a number
        - Maybe on the little yellow arrow next to your adrenaline
    - Much cooler idea
        - Visual feedback on the character itself
        - Ask me about this I have to show it

#### M1

- I think if we remove the falloff from the blast attack’s damage it’ll be *chef’s kiss* perfect
    - A little boost to range both forward and lateral would be super nice
- CWCID: That being said, you did push its range out in the first place, whereas I feel most people would have tried to make it closer to the character to be more in line with the visuals, but in reality that’s not how games work and i’m ranting at this point
    - This might seem like a small or obvious thing, but it’s pretty important for feeling nicer to land hits and I super appreciate it.
- It might be good to have it reduce your Y velocity like the other melees
    - To the some days earlier about other melee characters’ “sticking power”, Kamigear mentioned to me why he assumed mercenary had this as well, which is that he felt like it was pulling you toward wandering vagrants when you hit them
    - I realized this is because when you land melee hits, your Y velocity is set (I think) to 0, so you’re able to stay in the air longer and land more hits. I think Miner could benefit from this

#### M2

- CWCID: I like how versatile it is because you can aim differently to move aim to hit multiple people, aim straight down to get all the explosions on one guy. It’s pretty fun
    - Was this planned or was just a way to implement a long hitbox along the dash that just ended up turning out frickin great?
- Have it scale with attack speed like Merc and Commando R (we should have a term for this)
    - I stand by your decision to have a max on it, cause with adrenaline this’ll just get too broken, and of course I also like it to wind up super faster with high attack speed
    - However I do think that making it more powerful with higher adrenaline is a good thing.
    - Perhaps instead of stacking with attack speed, It stacks with adrenaline itself
        - This’ll give us more control of the balancing by choosing how many hits come out with how many stacks,
        - It’ll also separate this from your attack speed bonus with syringes n such, which I feel uncomplicated this as well and also gives us more control
        - Now windup speed is just based on your attack speed, which I feel makes it less muddied, design wise, when attack speed affected both windup speed and amount of hits

#### SHIFT

- Thanks for the anti wisp tool oh man it’s nice
- A teeny tiny bit of startup frames would go a long way to make this move feel more satisfying.
    - Far be it from me to suggest input delay in a game, but it was actually jarring to press shift and have a huge explosion with knockback just pop up without any windup.
        - Maybe that’s because I’m used to Rex’s shift, but regardless I think it would be good polish and make it feel more impactful

#### R

- Everyone’s already talked a bunch about it being less powerful against little peeps
    - Definitely agree on tightening the cone but only the middle section as we’ve talked about. That should be pretty good
        - Perhaps make inner cone bullets thiccer as well?
            - This’ll increase the chances of them hitting, while still not blowing the damage on bigger targets out of proportion
    - But yeah it’s a little frustrating that pretty commonly only 1 or none hit lemurians below me :/
- I think I want to be able to hold it to go higher,
    - and if I just tap it I stay at somewhat lower ground
    - Having it be more versatile to use at different heights might be nice, and would make it a little more effective on little thingies when you want it to
- I’d like to be able to jump _at_ people and do it.
    - I’d like the shootgun to come out a later in the move
    - I naturally wanna use it against golems, but it ends up a little clunky because I have to get right up on their grill to be properly on top of them
        - On the other hand I do like the risk/reward of having to get close to do more damage, hmm…
    - I do understand that this would mean the attack comes out higher, thereby reducing the damage
    - Perhaps have you hold it and when you let go it shoots the shoots
        - This however directly contradicts the above suggestion of holding it to go higher, which I would choose over this
    - Perhaps using the move pushes you forward a bit more as well as upward, keeping the timing
        - It would be based on your current speed, so you could still do it in place, and would help you jump at people if you’re moving (and sprinting) at them
        - Kinda like a slightly weaker wax quail
- Bug: Sometimes not jumping
    - Tried to figure out how this happens but I got nothing sry :c

#### General

- I want to activate skills by having the button held down when the skill comes off cooldown (instead of only on button press down)
    - I didn’t realize how much I rely on this with the other characters
    - Maybe not so much with SHIFT and R, but definitely with M2
- M2 and SHIFT
    - Might sound weird, but I’d like them to interrupt sprinting
        - I kept expecting them to stop my sprinting, since they’re violence moves
        - I’m used to doing moves and immediately pressing ctrl to start the sprinting again, so I’ve ended up stopping my sprint after using them
- M1 Animations
- With how fast your attack speed is encouraged to get, alternating your swinging arms in the animation would fit a lot more nicely.
    - - I am a huge fan of the double axe swing from the first game cause of how satisfying it felt, but this is an entirely different feeling attack
    - That being said, I think a teeny tiny bit of startup before the move comes out could go a long way to help the _feel_ of the move. Make it a bit more satisfying y’know?
        - Maybe bring that classic slower attack as a variant?
            - It could do more damage but have a windup and you can’t use it while sprinting
- Also had a random idea of an M1 variant where he throws the pickaxes but idk what are the true ramifications of making him a ranged attacker.
    - Could be neat could be a catasTROPHICALLY MESSING with the nATURAL ORDER
- Mind if I set up the blend trees for the running? I won’t let ya down
- CWCID: found myself several times just goin “dang this is fun”
    - bravo bravo
    - Super looking forward to this being even more realized. He fits super well in the game
- Also looking forward to being able to help out on it some more maybe here and there maybe perhaps maybe?
- One single item display rule for glasses. That is all I desire

#### Room for moer

- When I’m spamming m1 too fast, the other moves won’t come out consistently. Hopefully the hold-to-activate-when-it-comes-off-cooldown thing fixes this. Could also be a priority thing

### 

### The big round 2

- so most of these are immediate thoughts. I’ll be changing my mind around a bunch about them the more I play and write and think
- Most of it’s wrong lol, skip to the end if you like
    - Even those could be ignored
- Truthfully, you can probably release it as is (when you get the icons n descriptions n stuff of course).
    - ~~The only real issue to fix is the bug with the new R but even then I don’t think people will mind, it doesn’t crash the game or actually ruin the experience.~~

#### First Impressions

- Fuckin love new m2 ramming into shit is great
- Fucking love new shift pulling shit together is great
- Fucking intrigued by new R. probably needs some getting used to but I like it
    - First impression is letting mines down kinda goes against the brawler aspect of him, but I’m pretty quickly changing my mind about this, and I’m sure once i play it better it’ll fit super great
    - That being said it’s probably got the most interesting interaction with adrenaline. Building up adrenaline to get more stacks is a super interesting and fun direction to go with it
    - Where dem cooldowns at? I know you said you’re working on it
        - Actually curious why it’s not there? Is it kinda hard coded for some work around you needed?
            - If so is there gonna be an issue with cooldown reduction/reset stuff like bandoliers?
- Using new shift and new m2 ramming into them is rad
    - At first impression i was like hmm maybe it’s kinda too good they directly combo into each other, but then I realized old M2 would combo just as awesomely

#### Moar round 1

- O shit I just realized the R is like a mining blast charges for mining that’s fuckin rad
    - Hmm well fucking love laying down new R and pulling kniggas into it
- That being said, new SHIFT combos really well with new R, but maybe _too_ well to the point where I’ll never want to use new R without it
    - Perhaps this kinda combo interaction ain’t so bad. There’s a bunch of other move variants that are like that
    - never want - well i might want maybe to use old shift to stun then i can spread out new R yeah that’ll be ok,
        - but probably still not as good as pulling them all in to another pile
    - with new R - Then i realized o shit this completely also combos amazingly with old R as well so nevermind maybe?
- I’m just running into maybe new SHIFT is way too good compared to the original
    - Where I can’t see myself picking old SHIFT over this
    - With more feeling it out we might learn the no damage part of it balances it enough or not enough
    - But early thoughts right now are we might need to nerf this (remove/greatly shorten stun (though this might already be the case compared to the original)) and/or buff the first one (super increase range (perhaps with adrenaline (though idk if it already does that)))
        - u remove/greatly shorten stun - This’ll make it kinda more of a risk reward thing, and the original is more for safeties/big damages
- I like the skill ceiling on new shift,
    - Right now it feels like there’s a lot of room to figure out different ways to use it and that’s cool
- Would love to hold R to just puke out the bombs continuously
    - Gotta have it not stop your m1 if you don’t have any charges handy

#### Moar day 2

- ~~Big ol bug with the Rs~~
    - ~~Got a clip for ya~~
    - In fact i recorded the whole thing just in case lol
- Something something new R is more useful both in general use and with aoe than old R
    - Maybe old R peirce?
- Just noticed how beefy new SHIFT’s range is and
    - Oof super good
    - Maybe maybe too good but I don’t wanna nerf that cause the utility is super nice and feels nice
        - I’m sure it’s in a fine place the way it is
        - Maybe have it fall off? Enemies within half or 60-70% of the range goes straight to the center reliably like it does now, but the edges of the range pull it in less?
- Man where’d this pussy attitude come from I just wanna nerf everything huh

#### Moar day 3 havin fun edition

- It don’t remember my selections :c
    - Super low priority but yeah seems to be a thing with custom characters but idk
- Maybe the charges should be a little bigger? Easier to land on stuff
    - Maybe that’ll make it too easy to stick to stuff you don’t want it to stick on but I can’t think really of a situation where that’d be
        - Maybe too easy to stick to yourself so in that case have it be a lower range for you but still higher range for enemies/bosses
            - But this is all polish we don’t need
    - Main and easiest thing is increase the size of projectiles
        - And I’d add a little trailrenderer on it
            - like commando’s grenades now that I think about it
                - That’s polish too but it’s a lot easier/simpler
- Leaning back toward the stop/squeeze your Y velocity when you hit things thing
    - Just tried to fight a alloy worship ball and just couldn’t do any hits on him unless I was on top
    - Issue is with how fast your attack speed wants to go, you’re gonna run into just being stuck in one spot forever.
    - I wanna test this with other melee folks but maybe put a minimum on how much it shortens the y velocity so you still fall a bit

#### Probably not wrong stuff

- ~~Bug with the new R.~~
    - ~~Got a clip of it~~
        - ~~It just explodes infinitely it’s kinda funny~~
            - ~~I don’t think people will mind. It just does extra damage for no reason~~
    - ~~Oh yeah stacktrace~~
- ~~[Error : Unity Log] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object~~
- ~~Stack trace:~~

- Bug: when standing on top of vagrants or worship units, hitting straight down at them does less damage
    - It aims the blast too far down in the hitbox so you end up only landing the sourspot of the blast
    - To rectify this you gotta aim kinda higher so the center of your blast happens close to the surface
        - ez fix no falloff total range damage baybee
            - But if you still want a sourspot yeah you’ll have to fix the sourspot also being closest to you I think
- New shift might be a little unbalanced but I’ll feel it out and find out
    - Lower stun? Make it a slow instead cause hey we’re invincible anyway?
    - Buff original shift?
    - Up to you
- Fuckin love it. I was playing it and was like damn this guy’s good at making skills
- Wanna throw me a super secret special puple skin just for one dll?
- I noticed that when you’re holding M1 to attack and you press R, it stops your M1 even if you don’t have any charges ready
- Bug: R charges sometimes stay stuck in the air instead of sticking on enemies
    - Only seen this happen on Vagrants and Worship Units
        - I’m assuming this is because the tops of those guys are considered “ground” by the game
- Bug: R charges only attach to character colliders (and none of the hurtboxes)
    - Sometimes it looks like it goes straight through an enemy it clearly should have landed on
        - People won’t like that

#### Old points

- When I’m spamming m1 too fast, the other moves won’t come out consistently. Hopefully the hold-to-activate-when-it-comes-off-cooldown thing fixes this. Could also be a priority thing
- Oh yeah the the hold-to-activate-when-it-comes-off-cooldown thing
- Ancient scepter?
