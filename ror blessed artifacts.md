# Cursed Artifacts

~~Spite command honor enigma chaos~~ glass diss evo ~~meta~~ sacrifice ~~kin swarm death frailty soul veng~~

## yeh

### Command → Mutiny

- Same menu comes up, gives a random item that you _didn’t_ choose

### Soul → Posesssion

- Killing wisps turns them into different ghost enemies

### Death → Reaping

- Kills all enemies in a range around them
- Or Fuck it all enemies suicide and you get no gold

### Sacrifice → Summoning

- Chance on enemy spawn that Instead the enemy, an item spawns, and picking it up spawns the enemy
- Still no chest

### Spite → Resentment

- Enemies drop bombs when they spawn instead of when they die
- Or Enemies constantly drop bombs while they’re not dead

### Chaos → Unity

- Attacks heal allies

### Enigma → Phenom(ena)

- Your equipment is back to normal
- Equipments that you pick up randomize after you pick them up
- They show up as small enigma from ror1

### Vengeance → Redemption

- Occasionally spawn the umbra with your items but on your team
- Or occasionally spawn one of the enemies as an umbra on your team
    - And with your items

### Frailty → Reinforcement

- No fall damage but you bounce now
- I gotta feel out Frailty so I can come up with something that feels cursed about it
- Lol heal when you fall
- Gain barrier instead of fall damage

### Honor → Trickery

- Allies are all elite types at once
- No elites?
- You’re elite?
    - Eh it’s straight up positive but i’m down
    - The straight up negative artifacts become positive that’s probably fine
    - It’s also just kinda boring; not out there enough, I feel.
- Previous thoughts
    - On the disgrace thing, enemies are weaker and easier but just give you fuckin nothing cause that’s what you deserve for taking the easy route
    - Yeah that. never elites
    - On second thought I don’t wanna really punish people for actually playing with honor, so back to the drawing board
        - But I mean that’s the entire point of this mod, no?
        - If not punishment stasts wise, than it just makes it piss easy instead of shit hard

### Kin → HiveMind

- All picked up allies become the same ally,
    - randomized at the start any of the allies in the game
    - Healing drones only, big beetles only, happy mask just spawns more beetles, squid polyp just spawns more gunner drones
        - ALL SQUIDS
            - So in this case i’ll make the squid health deterioration depending on the original spawn
                - New folks that turned into squids don’t drain
                - New folks that came _from_ squids drain even if they aren’t squids
                - Same with happy mask ghosts n such

### Metamorphosis → Conversion, Transformation

- Instead of random characters are played in order
- Still randomized characters but Randomized characters are eliminated from the pool and it resets
    - or you get stuck with the last one
- What if i renamed evo to meta and meta to evo even though their cursed variants are in no way similar
    - Biologically that’s what the words be lol

## Below this point these are relatively undecided

### Swarm → ~Fusion

- Kniggas are less and have double health
- Perhaps they fuse with kniggas nearby

### ~Glass → Crystal

- Pretty simple
- This would be just unfun though. Surviving forever but doing no damage idk
- The flip could be that enemies are glass and you’re normal
    - - Well it’s just kinda the same at that point. Ey y not
    - Maybe instead of you’re normal you’re reverse glass
        - Up there I said titanium s unfun so if they’re all glass it kinda evens out, just the numbers are fuckin dumb now
        - Also the numbers are stacked on their side so the effect is compounded on them more I think actually now that I think about it probably not it’s still affecting them and multilpying all their stats as a whole anyways so never mind probably

### ~Evolution → ~Augmentation (civilization? integration?)

- You get items periodically
- only enemies can pickup item pickups
- It goes in their shared inventory too so like woah
- That means enemies buy chests lol
    - In that case it’ll just be they walk by the chest and it open. Idk how I’d factor money into this.
- Also just pick up stuff in sacrifice off the corpses of their comrades
    - But wait instead of sacrifice it’ll be summoning where they pick up the items and more enemies will spawn and that’s hilarious
- Potential problem:
    - If you just get items periodically, there’s gonna be no fuckin way to for you to scale as fast as the game is scaling, especially if they’re picking up items now.
    - Oh well. A problem for for future me he can handle that
        - Lol good luck nerd
- Alt: enemies get _your_ items, and you gotta get em bac

### Dissonance → Disarray

- Random stages from all tiers instead of random enemies from all tiers
- Just steal True dissonance from floodwarning?

## Further thoughts

- Wanna kinda map these out of like risk-reward also compared to their original counterparts
    - On the other hand who cares about balance
- When the fuck does it happen?
    - I want it to happen during a run
- Mayhaps it happens when you kill the shopguy
- Maybe just when you piss him off too
    - You put in a corrupt code into the artifact portal
        - You do a bulwark’s ambry with all the curse applied to your currentartifacts and they stay like that the rest of the run
- Leanin towards that one that one sounds good
    - Though I don’t wanna lock it behind stage 5
    - Or maybe I do
    - Artifact of corruption you just pick from the start?
- These are a lot like void items corrupting items, so maybe something related to the void?
