# The mod with Newtover and Marauder in it

TMWNaMIT

The Newtvoker and Marauder Mod

TNaMM

The longer this goes without a title the closer we get to releasing the mod straight up with that name

## Overview

A very vanilla expansion kinda deal that really borrows from the lore of the game. Mainly survivors and enemies, I have no interest in items lol. If a real team happens, stages would be rad

  
Survivors: Newtvoker and Marauder

Enemies: Split versions of Marauder that use one of his 3 weapons

## Newtvoker

![](<Attachments/Attachment 18.png>)![](<Attachments/Attachment 19.png>)

M1 simple somewhat limited attack to encourage casting spells

M2 Shatter

M3 Solidify

M4 Liquify

Or whatever the names were

In whatever the order is

Hit m2 m3 and m4, then hit m2 m3 or m4 again and they combine into one of 6 spells

Skeletor write the ideas go nuts

## Marauder

Clay guy modeled for tsunami. Name and model pending to be brought back to tsunami, if not I suppose we keep it.

M2 spear or javelin I think

M3 Sword and shield

M4 Axe

M1 weapon strings using the last weapon casted in the other skills
