## New Bots
- m1
- m2
- movement
- trickshot setup
- deflecting
### Whip Guy
latch on to things and spin around to damage with the line
- m1 energy whip
    - wind up animation
    - if holding input at whip crack time, latch
    - release to let go
    - anyone that makes contact with the whip is hurt
- m2 dash
    - hurts people based on your speed
    - use to initiate orbiting when your whip is latched
- movement: dash
- trickshot: just keep spinning
- deflecting: 
    - whip? 
    - during windup (and then you hit the thing you deflected with the whip)
- idk where to fit, probably an upgrade: pull enemy opposite your direction, so you can just spin around together and fly in a direction like a bolas
### Electrician
throw conductors and chain zap between them and enemies
- m1 zap
    - long sustained zap (let's say 6 bolts)
    - maybe just hold to keep zapping
    - chains 2 times, prioritizing conductors
- m2 throw conductor
    - if zapped duplicates the bolt at whatever chain length it was
        - or extends the chain by 2
        - conductor dies
- lightning prioritizes targets it hasn't hit before, but will still bounce back if nothing else is found
    - or maybe it's just random
- movement: if you directly target a conductor with m1, zap into it, then zap out a short distance in movement/input direction
- trickshot: repeated primary fire, and slight delay on chain lightning bouncing
- deflecting:
    - conductors block projectiles?
        - they're charged by enemy shots? 
- misc
    - electrical plug the robot
### Koal comboer
mix m1 and m2 to do fighting game combos
- 1, 11, 111 finisher
- 2, 22, 222 finisher
- 1, 11, 2, 22, can be mixed and matched indefinitely
- longer the combo the bettter the finisher
- sword and shield bot? chivalry knight bot like that's the joke it's medieval knight even though we're in robot age
    - 1 swipe\, 11 spin, 111 slam shield in the ground
    - 2 shield bash dash smash, 22 shield throw, 222 big sword stab
    - 1 and 2 are better single target, 11 has area, 22 has range
- movement: 2
- trickshot: finishers
- deflect: 2, 22, 111
### Desolator
- m1 shoot
    - does this game have debuffs?
    - applies 3 stacks of radiation on enemy
    - m1 and m2 damage increases per stack on enemy
- m2 spread the doom
    - hold to build up pump, release to spread a large area that applies radiation
        - stops movement. can be recasted indefinitely
        - goes on cooldown when you move or use primary
    - holding builds up strength up to a limit.
        - can keep holding past the limit, at the cost of health
        - if you don't release in time, you just die
- movement: increased speed in radiation zone?
    - stacks with each overlapped application of the zone
- trickshot: big lingering aoe
- deflect: uh
- upgrades:
    - if you die while holding charge, you explode the amount charged
### Chrono Legionnaire
freeze an enemy in time. use chronosphere to isolate an enemy
- m1 tether to an enemy
    - freezes them, unable to do anything or be damaged
    - after a while, vanishes from existence
- m2 chronosphere
    - highlight an area, then highlight second area
    - enemies (not tethered, and not you) in the first area are teleported to the second area
    - welcome bugs, the food is on the floor and the door is open
- does not move normally:
    - project image while inputting movement, leaving body behind
    - stop inputting movement to teleport to image
    - after teleporting, disable self for a period of time based on teleport distance
- movement: teleport
- trickshot: vanish
- deflect: freeze projectiles in chronosphere initial highlight. on cast, projectiles are teleported, and converge under your control (or continue on their merry way)
- thoughts
    - gonna take a bit of a support role. use chronosphere to rearrange enemies for use by other bots, primary completely locks down a priority target
- upgrades:
    - primary chains to +1 target
    - chronosphere second area is smaller (pulling enemies together)
### Gatherer
- idk I just want someone to pull enemies together
- black hole? that explodes?
- wind magic?
### Stance Swapper
switch axe but robot
both stances react to being hit differently
### Katamari LOL
